# playTones

This is meant to be for me to learn how to use tone.js

## To do list

 - [ ] make a program with a button to play C major triad
 - [ ] select instrument, wave table
 - [ ] select ADSR
 - [ ] make lots of buttons to play all kinds of chords
 - [ ] make the buttons float around based on: current tonic, last chord played
 - [ ] draw lines between chords to represent types of transitions
